# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, as we are in active early development, only the latest `main` branch and the latest minor tag (e.g. `v0.3.x`) receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Black Vault seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it directly to the maintainers instead of opening a public issue.

You can reach out to us via email at:
- **David Vázquez Regueira:** d.vazquezr@udc.es

Please include the following information in your report:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact and an assessment of the severity.

We will try to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until an official patch has been released.
